# pennylane-qiskit
added from_qasm() and from_qiskit() functions to pennylane-qiskit library which they earlier removed. 


to use this functionality of from_qasm() and from_qiskit(), you need to go into the source code file of the pennylane-qiskit plugin, in the __init__.py file, copy and paste the code this repo's __init__.py file. 
and in that __init__.py file go in the source code of converters and paste the code of this repo's converter.py file. 

you can google to get to know, how to get into the source code using different IDEs.
